<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Vehicle Brake Systems and Subsystems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Drum Brake</li><li>Disc Brake</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The vehicle brake systems and subsystems market is primarily categorized into two main types: drum brakes and disc brakes. Drum brakes consist of a cylindrical drum that rotates with the wheel, using brake shoes to press against the inner surface for friction. In contrast, disc brakes employ a flat rotor that spins alongside the wheel, with calipers squeezing brake pads against the rotor to create stopping power. Both systems are essential for vehicle safety, each offering distinct advantages in performance and application.</p></p>
